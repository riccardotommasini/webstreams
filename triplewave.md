TripleWave is an open-source tool,  under Apache 2.0 license, to publish streams to the Web. It is a reusable and generic resource that enables the publication of [RDF Streams](https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/) on the Web. It is independent of any specific engine implementation, and it can be fed with existing Web streams (e.g. Twitter and Wikipedia streams) or time-annotated RDF datasets (e.g. the Linked Sensor Data dataset). It can be invoked through both pull- and push-based mechanisms, thus enabling RSP engines to automatically register and receive data from TripleWave.

TripleWave is available in <a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/TripleWave">Github</a>. Instructions about how to install and configure it are available in the [documentation](http://streamreasoning.github.io/TripleWave/docs.html) page. You can find additional material, such as publications and presentations, in [this](http://streamreasoning.github.io/TripleWave/publications.html) page.
